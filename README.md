This project was created to mark an automated attendance system using Python and machine learning.

****FACE RECOGNITION-BASED AUTOMATED ATTENDANCE SYSTEM****

**ABSTRACT:**
Automatic face recognition (AFR) technologies have made many
improvements in the changing world. Smart Attendance using Real-Time
Face Recognition is a real-world solution that comes with day-to-day

activities of handling student attendance systems. A face recognition-
based attendance system is a process of recognizing the student's face

for taking attendance by using face biometrics based on high-definition
monitor video and other information technology. In my face recognition
project, a computer system will be able to find and recognize human
faces fast and precisely in images or videos that are being captured
through a surveillance camera. Numerous algorithms and techniques
have been developed for improving the performance of face recognition
but the concept to be implemented here is Deep Learning.

**INTRODUCTION:**
With the advancement of technologies every day, humanity is
slowly going towards contactless everything. It is quite evident that the
future ahead of us will become so advance that maybe 90%+
things that we are doing right now will be either automated or become
contactless. One such advancement will be facial recognition technology
or FR tech, which is the prime focus of this article.
Facial recognition technology is a system or software which is capable
enough to verify the identity of a person by analyzing an image or
video footage. Some of the technologies or software are so advanced
that even blurred pictures are sometimes rendered enough and analyzed
to know the identity of the person. So many are the advantages of this
system that it would take a long article to note down each one of them.
But today, our prime focus will be on one of the many applications of
facial recognition technology, and that is using face recognition-based
attendance systems.

**REQUIREMENT:**
Python 3
Anaconda
PYQT5
Face recognition lib
OpenCV lib
OS: Windows 7 or higher/Mac-os/Linux
Min 1 Gb of RAM
Min 32/64 bit architecture

**WORKING EXPLANATION:**
Facial recognition technology can be used in recording the
attendance through a high-resolution digital camera that detects and
recognizes the faces of the students and the machine compares the
recognized faces with students’ face images stored in the database. Once
the face of the student is matched with the stored image, then the
attendance is marked in the attendance database for further calculation.
If the captured image doesn't match the students' face present in
the database then this image is stored as a new image onto the
database. In this system, there are possibilities for the camera not to
capture the image properly or it may miss some of the students from
capturing.

**CONCLUSION:**
Thus, this project aims to capture the video of the students,
convert it into frames, and relate it with the database to ensure their
presence or absence, mark attendance to the particular student to
maintain the record. The Automated Classroom Attendance System

helps in increasing the accuracy and speed ultimately achieving high-
precision real-time attendance to meet the need for automatic classroom evaluation


**FUTURE SCOPE:**
An automated Attendance System can be implemented in larger areas
like in a seminar hall where it helps in sensing the presence of many
people.
Sometimes the poor lighting condition of the classroom may affect the image
quality which indirectly degrades system performance, this can be
overcome in the latter stage by improving the quality of the video or by using some algorithms
